# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! Explore a collection of projects I've created in my spare time. I've used data from various sources, such as Kaggle and online courses, to bring these projects to life. Each one showcases my dedication to uncovering insights from data.

Please note that, due to confidentiality agreements during my tenure at companies, I am unable to share the work I did in those roles here. However, these personal projects are a testament to my passion for data analysis. Join me on this data-driven journey to discover meaningful stories within the numbers.
