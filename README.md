# Data-Analytics-Portfolio

Hi, I’m Chen! I’m a Data Analyst with 7+ years of experience in SQL, Excel, and visualization tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio, along with some background in Python. Here you’ll find a collection of projects where I applied my skills to turn data into insights.

Please note that due to confidentiality agreements during my professional roles, I am unable to share the work I did in those positions here. However, these personal projects reflect my passion for data analysis and serve as practical demonstrations of my skills.
