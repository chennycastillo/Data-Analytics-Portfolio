# Data-Analytics-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! I'm an experienced Data Analyst with over 6 years in the field, driven by a passion for continuous learning and skills expansion. Explore a collection of projects I've created in my spare time, where I've used data from various sources, including Kaggle and online courses, to bring these projects to life. Each project showcases my dedication to uncovering insights from data.

Please note that, due to confidentiality agreements during my tenure at companies, I am unable to share the work I did in those roles here. However, these personal projects are a testament to my passion for data analysis and my ongoing journey to enhance my Python skills.

Thank you for joining me on this journey of growth, and I appreciate your interest in my portfolio!
